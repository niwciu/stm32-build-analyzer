## ❓ Why This Fork?

The original version was depandet with cmake-tool extension.  
This fork removes that dependency, adds broader file handling, and enhances the UI for developers using CubeIDE, Makefiles, or custom setups.

## 🚀 Key Improvements in This Fork

✅ **Removed CMake dependency** – Works with any build system (Makefile, CubeIDE, etc.)  
✅ **Custom build folder support** – Easily set via UI button or command  
✅ **Improved file discovery** – More robust handling of `.map` and `.elf` files  
✅ **Optimized UI** – Visual memory usage indicators and new interactive controls

## 🔍 Features

- Memory region analysis using `.map` and `.elf` files
